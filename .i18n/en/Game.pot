msgid "The `symm` tactic is easy to use and understand.\n"
"It changes goals of the form `⊢ X = Y` to `⊢ Y = X`. Here `X`\n"

"all `X`s in the goal to `Y`s. It's the way to \\\"substitute in\\\".\n"
"\n"

"then\n"

"\n"
"## Common errors\n"
"\n"
"* You need the square brackets. `rw h` is never correct.\n"
"\n"
"* If `h` is not a *proof* of an *equality* (a statement of the form `X = Y`)\n"
"or a *bi-implication* (a statement of the form `X ↔ Y`),\n"
"for example if `h` is a function or an implication,\n"
"then `rw` is not the tactic you want to use. For example,\n"
"`rw [P = Q]` is never correct: `P = Q` is the theorem *statement*,\n"
"not the proof. If `h : P = Q` is the proof, then `rw [h]` will work.\n"
"\n"
"## Details\n"
"\n"
"The `rw` tactic is a way to do \\\"substituting in\\\". There\n"
"are two distinct situations where you can use this tactic.\n"
"\n"
"1) Basic usage: if `h : A = B` is an assumption or\n"
"the proof of a theorem, and if the goal contains one or more `A`s, then `rw [h]`\n"
"will change them all to `B`'s. The tactic will error\n"
"if there are no `A`s in the goal.\n"
"\n"
"2) Advanced usage: Assumptions coming from theorem proofs\n"
"often have missing pieces. For example `subset_def`\n"
"is really a proof that `?₁ ⊆ ?₂ ↔ ∀ x ∈ ?₁, x ∈ ?₂`,\n"
"or, if you like, a proof that `∀ S T, S ⊆ T ↔ ∀ x ∈ S, x ∈ T` because `subset_def` really\n"
"is a function, with `S` and `T` the inputs.\n"
"In this situation `rw` will look through the goal\n"
"for any subterm of the form `?₁ ⊆ ?₂`, and the moment it\n"
"finds a match it solves for the `?`s (e.g. `?₁ = A` and `?₂ = B`) and then\n"
"then changes all `A ⊆ B`s to `∀ x ∈ A, x ∈ B`s.\n"
"\n"
"If you can't remember the *name* of the proof of an equality or bi-implication, look it up in\n"
"the list of lemmas on the right."

msgid "## Summary\n"
"\n"
"If the goal is `∀ x, P x`, this mean that you have to prove something for every `x`.\n"
"A mathematician might say \"Now let `x` be arbitrary\". In Lean we say `intro x`.\n"
"This will change the goal to `P x`. Note we could equally say `intro fish`,\n"
"which would change the goal to `P fish`.\n"
"\n"
"If the goal is `P → Q`, then `intro h` will introduce `h : P` as a hypothesis,\n"
"and change the goal to `Q`. Mathematically, it says that to prove $P \\implies Q$,\n"
"we can assume $P$ and then prove $Q$.\n"
"\n"
"### Example:\n"
"\n"
"If your goal is `∀ x ∈ S, x ∈ T` then `intro a` will give you a new variable `a`\n"
"and the goal will become `a ∈ S → a ∈ T`. A second `intro h` will now give you the\n"
"hypothesis `h : a ∈ S`, and the goal will change to `a ∈ T`."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SetWorld.L01_subset_refl
msgid "## Summary\n"
"\n"
"This tactic has two distinct uses, with two distinct syntaxes:\n"
"\n"
"1) `apply <hypothesis or proof> at <hypothesis>`.\n"
"2) `apply <hypothesis or proof>`.\n"
"\n"
"Usage 1) with the `at` is *arguing forwards*. Usage 2 is *arguing backwards*.\n"
"\n"
"Note: `apply h` or `apply h at something` will *only work* if `h` is\n"
"a *function*, for example an *implication* `h : P → Q`.\n"
"\n"
"### More explanation\n"
"\n"
"1) If `t : P → Q` is a proof that $P \\implies Q$, and `h : P` is a proof of `P`,\n"
"then `apply t at h` will change `h` to a proof of `Q`. The idea is that if\n"
"you know `P` is true, then you can deduce from `t` that `Q` is true.\n"
"\n"
"2) If your goal is the possible conclusion of a theorem (which might have some\n"
"hypotheses), and if `h` is a *proof* of the theorem, then `apply h` will\n"
"apply the theorem to the goal. Sometimes it will prove it, and sometimes it\n"
"will *reduce* the goal of the level to some simpler goals.\n"
"\n"
"### Examples:\n"
"\n"
"1) (`apply` solving a goal.) `mem_univ` is the proof of the theorem `∀ x : 𝓧, x ∈ univ`. In other words,\n"
"`mem_univ` is a *function*, which takes as input a term of type `𝓧` and\n"
"returns a proof that `x ∈ univ`.\n"
"\n"
"So if you have `a : X` and your goal is to prove `⊢ a ∈ univ` then `exact mem_univ` will\n"
"*not work*, because `mem_univ` has a \"for all\" in, and the goal does not.\n"
"But `apply mem_univ` will work fine, as the `apply` tactic will figure out that\n"
"you want to set `x = a`.\n"
"\n"
"2) (`apply` changing a goal.) If your goal is `⊢ A ∪ B = univ` then `apply univ_subset`\n"
"will change it to `univ ⊆ A ∪ B`, because `univ_subset` says that for all sets `S`,\n"
"`univ ⊆ S` implies `S = univ`. The goal is now slightly logically easier.\n"
"\n"
"3) (`apply ... at` changing a hypothesis.) If you have `h : S ⊆ T` and you\n"
"`rw [subset_def] at h`, you'll get `h : ∀ (x : 𝓧), x ∈ S → x ∈ T`. If you\n"
"have a second hypothesis `haS : a ∈ S` then `apply h at haS` will turn `haS`\n"
"into a now poorly-named proof of `a ∈ T`.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly if `h₁ : log 37 ∈ S` then `apply h at h₁` will give you `h₁ : log 37 ∈ T`.\n"
"\n"
"### Bonus fact if you got to the end\n"
"\n"
"There's something in type theory called \"definitional equality\" which is part of\n"
"the wiring and is not mathematics in the traditional sense. It turns out\n"
"that `S ⊆ T` is *definitionally* equal to `∀ (x : 𝓧), x ∈ S → x ∈ T`, so\n"
"actually if `h : S ⊆ T` then you can just `apply h` to change `⊢ 42 ∈ T` to\n"
"`⊢ 42 ∈ S`. For another example, go back to set world level 1 and try `intro x`\n"
"as your first move. What's going on is that the proof of `subset_def` is `rfl`."

"\n"
"## What is this game?\n"
"\n"
"There's a mathematical object called a *filter*. It doesn't get much love.\n"
"It's not often taught in an undergraduate degree. Furthermore, there are\n"
"bad ways to teach it, which can end up with you being more confused than\n"
"when you started. Indeed, the author of this game was confused about filters\n"
"for many years.\n"
"\n"
"This game is an attempt to explain filters in an intuitive way, as\n"
"\"generalised sets\". If you have been brainwashed by the textbook\n"
"approach to mathematics, you'll know that infinity is not a number,\n"
"that `dy/dx` doesn't mean `dy` divided by `dx` because `dx` isn't\n"
"a number, and that `0.999999999999999... = 1` because the difference\n"
"between them is infinitely small, and there are no infinitely small\n"
"numbers apart from `0`. Well, filters let you recover these intuitive\n"
"ideas in a rigorous way which doesn't lead to contradictions.\n"
"\n"
"## What are the prerequisites for playing?\n"
"\n"
"First, there are some mathematical prerequisites. You will need to know\n"
"about the abstract concepts of sets and subsets, and functions between sets.\n"
"You don't need much more than that. You can learn about these ideas\n"
"in any first course or textbook on abstract mathematics, for example\n"
"Martin Liebeck's book \"A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics\".\n"
"\n"
"And then there are some Lean prerequisites. Lean is an interactive\n"
"theorem prover, and this game is written in Lean; you can see\n"
"the source code to the game [here](https://github.com/kbuzzard/FilterGame)\n"
"on GitHub, and even clone it yourself and add your own levels if you want.\n"
"In this game I will assume you know the following basic Lean tactics:\n"
"`intro`, `apply`, `exact` and `rw`. If you don't know these tactics, then you could\n"
"try playing a few worlds in the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4).\n"
"If you've platyed through Tutorial World, Addition World and Implication World in that\n"

"\n"
"The Filter Game has been a long time coming. I (Kevin Buzzard)\n"
"started experimenting with it in about 2020. The first Lean 4 project\n"
"I ever embarked on in 2021 was some Filter Game levels (I had to define\n"
"a filter in Lean 4 as part of it!). I then supervised a second\n"
"year group project on filters in 2023, and Billy Miao put together\n"
"a preliminary version (in Lean 3) as part of the project. I thank\n"
"Billy Miao, Lily Frost, Yichen Feng and Archie Prime for their thoughts on\n"
"how things should be put together.\n"

"What finally pushed this game into something which I felt was finally\n"
"ready, was the London Mathematical Society, who invited me to give\n"
"a course as part of their 2024 Summer School at the University of Essex.\n"
