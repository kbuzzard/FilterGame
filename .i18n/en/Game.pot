msgid "# Welcome to the Filter Game\n"
"\n"
"## What is this game?\n"
"\n"
"There's a mathematical object called a *filter*. It doesn't get much love.\n"
"It's not often taught in an undergraduate degree. Furthermore, there are\n"
"bad ways to teach it, which can end up with you being more confused than\n"
"when you started. Indeed, the author of this game was confused about filters\n"
"for many years.\n"
"\n"
"This game is an attempt to explain filters in an intuitive way, as\n"
"\"generalised sets\". If you have been brainwashed by the textbook\n"
"approach to mathematics, you'll know that infinity is not a number,\n"
"that `dy/dx` doesn't mean `dy` divided by `dx` because `dx` isn't\n"
"a number, and that `0.999999999999999... = 1` because the difference\n"
"between them is infinitely small, and there are no infinitely small\n"
"numbers apart from `0`. Well, filters let you recover these intuitive\n"
"ideas in a rigorous way which doesn't lead to contradictions.\n"
"\n"
"## What are the prerequisites for playing?\n"
"\n"
"First, there are some mathematical prerequisites. You will need to know\n"
"about the abstract concepts of sets and subsets, and functions between sets.\n"
"You don't need much more than that. You can learn about these ideas\n"
"in any first course or textbook on abstract mathematics, for example\n"
"Martin Liebeck's book \"A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics\".\n"
"\n"
"And then there are some Lean prerequisites. Lean is an interactive\n"
"theorem prover, and this game is written in Lean; you can see\n"
"the source code to the game [here](https://github.com/kbuzzard/FilterGame)\n"
"on GitHub, and even clone it yourself and add your own levels if you want.\n"
"In this game I will assume you know the following basic Lean tactics:\n"
"**TODO** fill these in. If you don't know these tactics, then you could\n"
"try playing a few worlds in the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4).\n"
"If you've platyed through Tutorial World, Addition World and Implication World in that\n"
"game, then you know enough about Lean to play the Filter Game.\n"
"\n"
"## Getting started\n"
"\n"
"If you satisfy the prerequisites, get started by clicking on `Set World`!"

msgid "Version 0.1.0: experimental prerelease.\n"
"\n"
"## History\n"
"\n"
"The Filter Game has been a long time coming. I (Kevin Buzzard)\n"
"started experimenting with it in about 2020. The first Lean 4 project\n"
"I ever embarked on in 2021 was some Filter Game levels (I had to define\n"
"a filter in Lean 4 as part of it!). I then supervised a second\n"
"year group project on filters in 2023, and Billy Miao put together\n"
"a preliminary version (in Lean 3) as part of the project. I thank\n"
"Billy and the other group members **TODO** for their thoughts on\n"
"how things should be put together.\n"
"\n"
"What finally pushed this game into something which I felt was finally\n"
"ready, was the London Mathematical Society, who invited me to give\n"
"a course as part of their 2024 Summer School at the University of Essex.\n"
"I chose to give a course on filters, and made this game as part of\n"
"the learning experience for the students."
